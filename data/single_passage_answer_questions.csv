2,What were the requirements for the project?,"The tool had the following requirements:
- Chatbot that you can ask questions and get answers in response (conversational memory is not required).
- Information is taken from an unstructured text file.
- It must be able to tell me if it doesn’t know the answer to my question.
- Fast.
- Efficient enough to run on my MacBook with other programs without any performance issues.
- Locally run for privacy and to ensure it will always be free, runnable, and consistent."
2,What data did was used to test the prototype?,Grace Hopper's Wikipedia page and Alan Turing's Wikipedia page were used to test the prototype.
3,How do the data storage options compare?,"For fast start: use SQLite3 and ChromaDB (File-based) out-of-the-box - no install required.
For speed + scale: use MongoDB (text collection) and Milvus (vector db) - install with Docker Compose
For postgres: use Postgres for both text collection and vector DB - install with Docker Compose
For mix-and-match: LLMWare supports 3 text collection databases (Mongo, Postgres, SQLite) and 10 vector databases (Milvus, PGVector-Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, Mongo-Atlas, Qdrant, Faiss, LanceDB, ChromaDB and Pinecone)."

If you provided the analysis that resulted in a pricing change that saved the company millions, then you deserve part of the credit for that impact."
6,What kinds of models would need to be officially registered?,"High-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration. The latter will have to be registered in a non-public part of the database that will be only accessible to relevant supervisory authorities."
6,"What kinds of AI carry ""systematic risks""?","For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model)."

Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions.

When measured on the Masked-R-CNN deep learning architecture the Tesla A100 was 1.47x faster than the Tesla V100. When measured on the Transformer (12 layer, Machine Translation, WMT14 en-de) deep learning architecture, the Tesla A100 was 1.70x faster than the Tesla V100."
11,For what work did I receive criticism for my reduction of FLOPS?,You received criticism for your research on sparse network training.
12,How does function exporting differ between Gleam and Python?,"In Python, top level functions are exported by default. There is no notion of private module-level functions. In Gleam, functions are private by default and need the pub keyword to be public."
