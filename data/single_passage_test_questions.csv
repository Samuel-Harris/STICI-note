3,How do the data storage options compare?,"For fast start: use SQLite3 and ChromaDB (File-based) out-of-the-box - no install required.
For speed + scale: use MongoDB (text collection) and Milvus (vector db) - install with Docker Compose
For postgres: use Postgres for both text collection and vector DB - install with Docker Compose
For mix-and-match: LLMWare supports 3 text collection databases (Mongo, Postgres, SQLite) and 10 vector databases (Milvus, PGVector-Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, Mongo-Atlas, Qdrant, Faiss, LanceDB, ChromaDB and Pinecone)."

4,When might I use caching?,"You might use caching when, for example, your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings."
6,What kinds of models would need to be officially registered?,"High-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration. The latter will have to be registered in a non-public part of the database that will be only accessible to relevant supervisory authorities."
6,"What kinds of AI carry ""systematic risks""?","For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model)."

When measured on the Masked-R-CNN deep learning architecture the Tesla A100 was 1.47x faster than the Tesla V100. When measured on the Transformer (12 layer, Machine Translation, WMT14 en-de) deep learning architecture, the Tesla A100 was 1.70x faster than the Tesla V100."

19,What categories does this paper split the RAG technique paradigm into?,"This paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation."
19,In what way can including unrelated documents affect the RAG system?,"Noise Power (Cuconasu et al., 2024) provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of IR components on RAG systems, revealing that the inclusion of irrelevant documents can significantly improve accuracy."
