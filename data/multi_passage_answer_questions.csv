Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks."

11,In what contexts is BERT mentioned?,"It is mentioned that for BERT large during training, the input and weight matrix of any matrix multiplication fit neatly into the L2 cache of Ada (but not other Us). The author also mentions that they benchmarked the time for 500 mini-batches for BERT Large during inference (excluding the softmax layer) on the 4x RTX 2080 Ti system.

12,What data structures does Gleam natively support?,"Gleam supports strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries."
12,What things will cause a compilation error in Gleam?,"In Gleam, let and = can be used for pattern matching, but you’ll get compile errors if there’s a type mismatch. Functions can optionally have their argument and return types annotated in Gleam. These type annotations will always be checked by the compiler and throw a compilation error if not valid.

The following code will also throw a compilation error:
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch"
13,Where is broadcasting used?,"Broadcasting is used to do the < comparision between the column vector [0, 1, 2, 3] and the row vector [0, 1, 2, 3], which is one of the steps to make a causal language modelling mask. Broadcasting is also used to add pos_emb and tok_emb elementwise to get the new representations of the tokens with positional information."

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

Finally, at the end of the story, Jackie licked the cracks on her lips as her eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on her tongue. She felt herself drift, which she thought a good thing, because she needed the rest."

19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers."
19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries."
