36,9,False,"What is the meaning behind the infrared scenes?", "The significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the Polish family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members."
37,9,False,"How do the people who commit atrocious acts and those that are complicit in these acts differ?","The Zone of Interest does not really differentiate between evil-doers and those supporting such evil."

47,11,True,"In what contexts is BERT mentioned?","It is mentioned that for BERT large during training, the input and weight matrix of any matrix multiplication fit neatly into the L2 cache of Ada (but not other Us). The author also mentions that they benchmarked the time for 500 mini-batches for BERT Large during inference (excluding the softmax layer) on the 4x RTX 2080 Ti system. They chose BERT Large inference since, from their experience, this is the deep learning model that stresses the GPU the most."
