button = mo.ui.run_button()
button

mo.stop(not button.value, ""Click 'run' to generate a random number"")

import random
random.randint(0, 1000).","
To make a button, you can use the marimo library and create a button using the mo.ui.button function. You can also set an on_click argument to specify what should happen when the button is clicked. For example, in the provided text document, a counter button is created by setting the value of the button to 0 and incrementing it on every click with the lambda function count: count + 1. To create a toggle button that toggles between True and False, you can use the same approach but set the on_click argument accordingly. The answer to your question is in the provided text document."
9,4,When might I use caching?,"You might use caching when, for example, your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings.","
You might use caching when you need to perform expensive computations that can be reused with the same inputs. This is particularly useful in situations where the same calculations are repeatedly performed with identical parameters, such as in the case of marimo's UI elements changing and triggering intermediate computation. Caching allows for faster retrieval of results by storing them for future use instead of recomputing them each time."

The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model).","
