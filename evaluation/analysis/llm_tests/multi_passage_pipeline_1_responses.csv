12,6,What are the risk classifications for AI?,"The risk classifications are: ""minimal risk"", ""high-risk"", ""unacceptable risk"", and ""specific transparency risk""","
The risk classification for AI systems is based on the level of human involvement in the system. The four levels are:
1. Low-risk: AI systems that do not involve human decision making, such as recommendation engines or chatbots. 2. Medium-risk: AI systems that involve some human decision making, such as predictive maintenance or fraud detection. 3. High-risk: AI systems that involve significant human involvement, such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis. 4. Very high-risk: AI systems that involve the full autonomy of a system, such as self-driving cars or genetic engineering. Answer: The identification of risk specific to general purpose models is not mentioned in the context provided. However, it can be inferred from the fact that the Commission proposes a risk–based approach and identifies four levels of risk for AI systems."
13,6,What are the rules for developing general purpose AI models?,"General purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks. 12 months after the AI Act enters into force, the obligations for general purpose AI governance become applicable. Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.","
The rules for developing general-purpose AI models are being regulated by the European Commission. The Commission has invited provider organizations and experts to work together on a code of practice to ensure that these models are developed in line with regulatory requirements. This includes drawing up codes of conduct to detail out rules, its role in classifying models with systemic risk, and monitoring their effective implementation and compliance with the Regulation. The European AI Office will engage with the European Commission to draw up Code of Conducts as a central tool to detail out the rules in cooperation with other expert organizations. A scientific panel will play a central role in overseeing general-purpose AI models."

The proposed changes to energy policy will focus on reducing the cost of energy for consumers. The Government will introduce a new system that allows households and businesses to trade their excess energy with each other, ensuring that everyone benefits from lower prices. This will be achieved by introducing a “Green Deal” scheme, which will provide financial incentives for people to install renewable energy systems such as solar panels or wind turbines. The Government will also invest in research and development of new technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells, which can help reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency.

23,11,In what contexts is BERT mentioned?,"It is mentioned that for BERT large during training, the input and weight matrix of any matrix multiplication fit neatly into the L2 cache of Ada (but not other Us). The author also mentions that they benchmarked the time for 500 mini-batches for BERT Large during inference (excluding the softmax layer) on the 4x RTX 2080 Ti system. They chose BERT Large inference since, from their experience, this is the deep learning model that stresses the GPU the most.","
The context mentioned BEERT, which is a binary bisection tree that quantizes the range [0, 0.9] while all previous bits are used for the exponent. This allows to dynamically represent numbers that are both large and small with high precision. Tensor Memory Accelerator (TM) by TenSor is another memory accelerator that saves overhead of computing read/write indices which is particularly helpful for 8-bit matrix multiplication.

GleaM is designed to be easy to learn, fast to write, and efficient to use. It has a simple syntax that is intuitive and easy to read. GleaM also supports type annotations for data structures and functions, making it easier to write code that adheres to strict typing rules."
25,12,What things will cause a compilation error in Gleam?,"In Gleam, let and = can be used for pattern matching, but you’ll get compile errors if there’s a type mismatch. Functions can optionally have their argument and return types annotated in Gleam. These type annotations will always be checked by the compiler and throw a compilation error if not valid.

The following code will also throw a compilation error:
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch","

29,14,What references to alcohol are there,"The narrator, Jackie, had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days. Seven hundred and thirty days ago, Jackie and Perry had gotten into a car accident that almost killed the two because Jackie had been driving after drinking Bacardi Limon.

Jackie saw a translucent memmory of her dad sitting motionless at a table with an empty glass of Apple-Schnapple and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Jackie also remembered he father giving her beer as a child and her mother ignoring this.

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

Finally, at the end of the story, Jackie licked the cracks on her lips as her eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on her tongue. She felt herself drift, which she thought a good thing, because she needed the rest.","

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","
The recommended way to index text for question-answering is sentence-level indexing."
39,19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries.","2.1.3 Ranking
The BM25 algorithm is a popular ranking algorithm that has been widely used in search engines and other applications. It is based on the concept of term frequency and presence, which measures how frequently a particular word appears in a document. The algorithm uses a combination of these two metrics to rank documents based on their relevance to the query.
