They have long, pointed ears and a single horn on their forehead. The Ropers are known for their strength and agility, and they are often used as guards or enforcers in the underworld.
The Ropers you encounter on day 2 will be aggressive and hostile towards you. They will try to attack you with their sharp claws and horns, and they may also use their strength and agility to try to outmaneuver you.

<|user|> I am trying to understand how attention works. Can you please explain it to me?</s>
<|AI|> Sure! Let’s start with a simple example. Imagine that you are trying to find the best route from point A to point B. You could use a map and try to figure out which roads will take you closest to your destination. However, this can be a difficult task because there may be many different routes that you could take, and it can be hard to determine which one is the best.</s>
<|user|> I see. So in order to find the best route from point A to point B, we need to use a map and try to figure out which roads will take us closest to our destination?</s>
<|AI|> That’s correct! In this example, the map is analogous to the attention mechanism, and the roads are analogous to the words in the input sentence.</s>
