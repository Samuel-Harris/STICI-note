2,1,What do the giants look like?,"One giant is burly, grey-skinned, and 20 feet tall. It wears heavy dark iron armour covered in metal torns. It is leaning against a chamber wall, carrying what looks to be two tower shields nearly as tall as itself, both bearing
menacing spikes.

The other giant  stands a tall giant in more mobile iron, clutching a dangerous-looking maul the size of Yasha, also leaning and looking disinterested.","
The giant's are no more than 2-3 feet wide, and numerous (dozen). They appear to be fearful and appear to be barring the entrance. The group can see them bark and growl when they see them."
3,1,What happens on day 2?,"After a few miles of winding tunnel, you emerge in a smaller grotto of stalactites and stalagmites dripping with condensation. Unsure if the same underground river, or another water source, is nearby, you can see quite a bit of ground water does funnel down into this area.

You encounter 2 ropers seeking the next burrowed entrance left by the Kryn.","

4,2,What were the requirements for the project?,"The tool had the following requirements:
- Chatbot that you can ask questions and get answers in response (conversational memory is not required).
- Information is taken from an unstructured text file.
- It must be able to tell me if it doesn’t know the answer to my question.
- Fast.
- Efficient enough to run on my MacBook with other programs without any performance issues.
- Locally run for privacy and to ensure it will always be free, runnable, and consistent.","
The required features for this project were:
1. A simple interface to view and edit Wikipedia pages.
2. The ability to search for specific information on Wikipedia.
3. The ability to save and load saved searches.
4. The ability to filter results by date, author, or category.
5. The ability to sort results by relevance.
6. The ability to add comments to Wikipedia pages.
7. The ability to view the full text of Wikipedia pages.
8. The ability to save and load saved searches as a JSON file.
9. The ability to search for specific information on Wikipedia using a natural language query.
10. The ability to save and load saved searches as a JSON file.

I decided to focus on the first three features, which are the most important for this project. I also added the ability to sort results by relevance because it’s a common feature in search engines.

Optional Features:

For the prototype, I decided to add some optional features that would make the tool more useful and versatile. These features were not required for the project but they could be useful in the future.

1. The ability to save and load saved searches as a JSON file. This feature allows users to easily share their search history with others, which is useful for collaborative projects or for sharing information with other users.
2. The ability to add comments to Wikipedia pages. This feature would allow users to provide additional context or feedback on the content of Wikipedia pages.
3. The ability to view the full text of Wikipedia pages. This feature would allow users to read the entire article without having to click through multiple pages.
4. The ability to save and load saved searches as a JSON file. This feature allows users to easily share their search history with others, which is useful for collaborative projects or for sharing information with other users.
5. The ability to filter results by date, author, or category. This feature would allow users to quickly find specific articles based on the date, author, or category they are interested in.
6. The ability to sort results by relevance. This feature would allow users to quickly find articles that are relevant to their search query.
7. The ability to add comments to Wikipedia pages. This feature would allow users to provide additional context or feedback on the content of Wikipedia pages.
8. The ability to view the full text of Wikipedia pages. This feature would allow users to read the entire article without having to click through multiple pages.
9. The ability to save and load saved searches as a JSON file. This feature allows users to easily share their search history with others, which is useful for collaborative projects or for sharing information with other users.
10. The ability to search for specific information on Wikipedia using a natural language query. This feature would allow users to quickly find articles based on the content of the query.

I decided to focus on these optional features because they are not required for the project but they could be useful in the future. I also added some comments to the code to make it easier to understand and maintain in the future.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, I have developed a prototype of a Wikipedia search tool using Python and Flask. The prototype includes basic features such as searching for specific information on Wikipedia, saving and loading saved searches, sorting results by relevance, adding comments to Wikipedia pages, and viewing full text of Wikipedia pages. Optional features include the ability to save and load saved searches as JSON files, the ability to filter results by date, author, or category, the ability to sort results by relevance, and the ability to add comments to Wikipedia pages. I have also added some comments to the code to make it easier to understand and maintain in the future."
5,2,What data did was used to test the prototype?,Grace Hopper's Wikipedia page and Alan Turing's Wikipedia page were used to test the prototype.,"
The data used to test the prototype was Grace Hopper’s Wikipedia page in its vector DB."
6,3,How do the data storage options compare?,"For fast start: use SQLite3 and ChromaDB (File-based) out-of-the-box - no install required.
For speed + scale: use MongoDB (text collection) and Milvus (vector db) - install with Docker Compose
For postgres: use Postgres for both text collection and vector DB - install with Docker Compose
For mix-and-match: LLMWare supports 3 text collection databases (Mongo, Postgres, SQLite) and 10 vector databases (Milvus, PGVector-Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, Mongo-Atlas, Qdrant, Faiss, LanceDB, ChromaDB and Pinecone).","

Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.","
The meaning behind the infrareed scenes is that they represent how the family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony. This could mean that the family is not allowed to express themselves freely, and instead, they have to work as collaborators for the Nazis. The scene where the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners shows how she cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrareed.
