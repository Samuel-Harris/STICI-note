However, based on historical context outside of this specific passage, Rudolf Höß and his family were involved in the Holocaayer's genocide efforts during World War II. It was under the Nazi regime that individuals like Rudolf Höss participated in the systematic persecution and murder of Jews among other groups deemed undesirable by the state. The specific items taken from Jewish families would have varied, but they often included personal belongings, valuables, and sometimes even family heirlooms as part of the broader atrocities committed during this period. It's important to note that while Rudolf Höss was a high-ranking official in Nazi Germany, the direct actions taken by his immediate family are not well-documented in historical records.
