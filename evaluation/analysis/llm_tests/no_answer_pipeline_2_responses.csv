Red-caped Bullet Kin behave like regular Bullet Kin, but have a red cap on their head. They will occasionally stop to releaase a cone of poison creep. They are immune to Poison effects. The cone of poison can only be releaased horizontally, so attacking from above or below are the safer options.

Trivia
Bullet Kin wield Red-Caped Bullet Kin. Assault-rifle wielding Bullet Kin wield AK-47s.
Incapacitated Bullet Kin can be found in the Oublilette and Cannon's boss room.

Occasionally, Bullet Kin will have assault rifles, in which case they will rapidly fire 8 bulletss towards the player before reloaiding. When an assault rifle wielding Bullet Kin appears, there will often be more in the same room.

Answer: "
4,2,Why was the H100 GPU chosen for computation?,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.,"
The H100 GPU is chosen for computation because it is one of the first widely used and easy-to-understand programming languages for mainframe computers. It has been in use since the 1970s, and its architecture is still widely used today. The M-series chip used by my MacBook is a different architecture altogether, with its own graphics API, metal, which is not required for GPU acceleration on my MacBook. As such, I do not expect much support for these architecture in the near future."
5,2,Which masked language model was chosen for the AI?,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.,"
The STICI-note is a chatbot that uses unsstructured text documents to enhance its responses. It was built using the smallest of the 5 models that I had found earlier, tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0 Q6_K, and it looks like hallucination are likely to be a major issue for this tool, but that is a problem I will solve when refining the AI."
6,3,When was GPT 4 made available,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.,"
The GPT-4 model is a large language model that was trained on the largest available dataset, the OpenAI GPT-3.5B model.
