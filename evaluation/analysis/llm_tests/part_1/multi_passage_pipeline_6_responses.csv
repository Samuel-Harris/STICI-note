12,6,What are the risk classifications for AI?,"The risk classifications are: ""minimal risk"", ""high-risk"", ""unacceptable risk"", and ""specific transparency risk""","
The risk classifications for AI are typically divided into four levels of risk, as proposed by the European Commission. These classifications help in identifying and managing potential risks associated with AI systems. The four levels of risk are:

1. Unacceptable risk: This level includes AI systems that pose a significant threat to human safety or fundamental rights. Examples include weapon systems, surveillance technology used for mass surveillance, and autonomous military robots.

2. High risk: These systems have the potential to cause substantial harm or infringe on human rights if they malfunction or are misused. Examples include credit scoring, recruitment algorithms, and automated decision-making in healthcare.

3. Limited risk: AI systems in this category may have minor negative consequences but do not pose a significant threat to safety or fundamental rights. Examples include recommendation engines, language translation tools, and image recognition software.

4. Minimal risk: These systems have negligible risks and are unlikely to cause any harm. Examples include simple calculators, spam filters, and navigation apps.

It is essential to note that the classification may vary depending on the specific use case and jurisdiction."
13,6,What are the rules for developing general purpose AI models?,"General purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks. 12 months after the AI Act enters into force, the obligations for general purpose AI governance become applicable. Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.","

24,12,What data structures does Gleam natively support?,"Gleam supports strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.","
Gleam natively supports tuples, records (structs), and maps. It also has support for custom types which can be used in much the same way as structs are used in Elixir. At runtime, they have a tuple representation and are compatible with Erlang records."
25,12,What things will cause a compilation error in Gleam?,"In Gleam, let and = can be used for pattern matching, but you’ll get compile errors if there’s a type mismatch. Functions can optionally have their argument and return types annotated in Gleam. These type annotations will always be checked by the compiler and throw a compilation error if not valid.

The following code will also throw a compilation error:
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch","
A compilation error in Gleam can occur when:

1. The types of arguments and return values do not match the expected type annotations.
2. A function is called with incorrect argument types.
3. An operation (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or comparison) is performed between incompatible types (e.g., trying to add an int and a float).
4. The syntax of the code does not conform to Gleam's language rules.
5. A variable or function name is not recognized by the compiler.
6. There are missing or incorrect type annotations for functions, variables, or expressions.
7. A required keyword (such as ""and"" in boolean and operations) is omitted or used incorrectly.
8. The code violates Gleam's rules regarding indentation and block structure.
9. A function or variable name is shadowed by another declaration within the same scope.
10. There are missing imports for external libraries or modules that are needed by the code.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, as there may be other factors that can cause a compilation error in Gleam."
