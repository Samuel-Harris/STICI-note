2,1,What do the giants look like?,"One giant is burly, grey-skinned, and 20 feet tall. It wears heavy dark iron armour covered in metal torns. It is leaning against a chamber wall, carrying what looks to be two tower shields nearly as tall as itself, both bearing
menacing spikes.

The other giant  stands a tall giant in more mobile iron, clutching a dangerous-looking maul the size of Yasha, also leaning and looking disinterested.","
The giant is a large, bipedal creature with a humanoid shape. They have long, spindly legs and arms that end in sharp claws. Their skin is rough and scaly, covered in dark, mottled scales. The head is small and round, with a pair of large, glowing eyes that seem to follow you around.
Their body is muscular and powerful, with a thick, armored shell that protects them from harm. They move slowly and deliberately, their movements fluid and graceful. Their main weapon is a massive, curved blade that they can wield with both hands.

The giant's appearance varies depending on the location. In some ruins, they appear as towering giants, standing over 10 feet tall. In others, they are smaller and more compact, standing no more than 6 feet tall. They have a distinctive scent that lingers in the air, a mix of earthy and metallic.

The giant's language is a complex, high-pitched growl that can be heard over the sound of their footsteps. They communicate primarily through gestures and body language, using their claws to indicate what they want or need.

When approached, the giant will often growl and bark, indicating that they are not pleased with your presence. If you try to approach them too closely, they may charge at you, but they are generally more aggressive when they feel threatened."

You encounter 2 ropers seeking the next burrowed entrance left by the Kryn.","

4,2,What were the requirements for the project?,"The tool had the following requirements:
- Chatbot that you can ask questions and get answers in response (conversational memory is not required).
- Information is taken from an unstructured text file.
- It must be able to tell me if it doesn’t know the answer to my question.
- Fast.
- Efficient enough to run on my MacBook with other programs without any performance issues.
- Locally run for privacy and to ensure it will always be free, runnable, and consistent.","

The inference model from scrapyc is a great choice for this project. It’s free, open-source, and has a lot of features that I need. The only downside is that it doesn’t have the ability to handle complex queries like “Who was Grace Hopper?” or “What was her Wikipedia page?”.

Optional features:

For the prototype, I decided to make very basic configurations for everything to develop it quickly, and I tested it by asking a question about Grace Hopper, one of the most influencial programmer to have ever lived, in two versions of the prototype: one with Grace Hopper’s Wikipedia page in its place, and another without.

I also decided to add some basic error handling to the prototype. If the user inputs an invalid query, I will display a message saying so and ask them to try again. This is important because users may not know what they’re doing when they ask questions like “Who was Grace Hopper?” or “What was her Wikipedia page?”.

11,5,Do I have to do something all by myself to be acknowledged for it?,"You don’t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it.

12,6,What kinds of models would need to be officially registered?,"High-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration. The latter will have to be registered in a non-public part of the database that will be only accessible to relevant supervisory authorities.","
The AI Act regulates general-purpose AI models by requiring that they be registered with the GDPR. The registration process involves submitting a model description, including information about the model's purpose and intended use, as well as information about its training data and any other relevant details. Once registered, these models are subject to certain obligations, including ensuring that they respect copyright law when training their models.

The GDPR has established a process for verifying compliance with these obligations. This includes reviewing the model's code and documentation, as well as testing its performance on relevant datasets. If the model is found to be in violation of any of these obligations, it may be subject to regulatory action, including being removed from the market or being required to undergo further verification.

Overall, the AI Act aims to ensure that general-purpose AI models are developed and used responsibly, while also protecting copyright law and other important rights and interests."
13,6,"What kinds of AI carry ""systematic risks""?","For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model).","

18,9,What is the meaning behind the infrared scenes?,"The significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the Polish family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.","
The use of infrareed in the text document is to convey the idea that the girl and her mother are not themselves as they step out of their house or into the open balcony. This could be interpreted as a symbolic representation of how the family cannot be themselves as they are forced to work for the Nazis, despite not wanting to.

23,11,For what work did I receive criticism for my reduction of FLOPS?,You received criticism for your research on sparse network training.,"
The reduction of FLOPS required for the network is not a significant improvement. The main reason for this is that the sparse matrix multiplication is still slow on GPUs, and the reduction in FLOPS does not yield speedups because GPUs cannot do fast sparse matrix multiplication.
