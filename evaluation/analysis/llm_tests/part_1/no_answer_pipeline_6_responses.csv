To create graphs, you can use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly in Python. Here's an example using Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some data for the plot
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a figure and a set of subplots
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the data
ax.plot(x, y)

# Set the title and labels for the plot
ax.set_title('Sine Wave')
ax.set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This code generates a sine wave plot using Matplotlib. You can customize it further by changing the data, adding more plots, or modifying the appearance of the plot."
