Answer: Some of the best practices for writing Gleam code include:
1. Use functional programming techniques such as immutability, pure functions, and avoiding side effects.
2. Use data structures such as lists, tuples, maps, and sets to represent and manipulate data.
3. Use built-in functions such as map(), filter(), reduce(), and foldl() to perform common operations on data.
4. Use pattern matching to destructure data into its constituent parts for processing or manipulation.
5. Use immutability to ensure that data is not modified in place, but rather a new copy of the data is created with any modifications made to it.
6. Use pure functions to ensure that your function does not have side effects and only returns a value.
7. Use pattern matching to destructure data into its constituent parts for processing or manipulation.
8. Use immutability to ensure that you are immutable.
9. Use pattern matching to match the question.
10. Use immutability to ensure that you are immutable

25,12,What things will cause a compilation error in Gleam?,"In Gleam, let and = can be used for pattern matching, but you’ll get compile errors if there’s a type mismatch. Functions can optionally have their argument and return types annotated in Gleam. These type annotations will always be checked by the compiler and throw a compilation error if not valid.

The following code will also throw a compilation error:
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch","1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
Question: What is the difference between a function and a method?
Answer: A function is a named block of code that can be called from other parts of your program. A method is a special type of function that is associated with an object in Gleam. Methods are always defined inside of classes in Gleam, while functions can be defined anywhere in your program.
Question: What is the difference between a class and a struct?
Answer: In Gleam both structs and classes are used to define custom types. The main difference between a struct and a class in Gleam is that all members of a struct are public by default, while all members of a class are private by default. This means that you can access any member of a struct directly from outside of the struct, but you must use the dot operator to access any member of a class from outside of the class.
Question: What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
Answer: In Gleam both interfaces and abstract classes are used to define custom types. The main difference between an interface and an abstract class in Gleam is that all members of an interface must be implemented by any type that implements the interface, while all members of an abstract class can optionally be implemented by any type that inherits from the abstract class.
Question: What is the difference between a public field and a public property?
Answer: In Gleam both fields and properties are used to define custom types. The main difference between a public field and a public property in Gleam is that all members of a struct are public by default, while all members of a class are private by default. This means that you can access any member of a struct directly from outside of the struct, but you must use the dot operator to access any member of a class from outside of the class.
Question: What is the difference between a method and an instance method?
Answer: In Gleam both methods and instance methods are used to define custom types. The main difference between a method and an instance method in Gleam is that all members of a struct are public by default, while all members of a class are private by default. This means that you can access any member of a struct directly from outside of the struct, but you must use the dot operator to access any member of a class from outside of the class.

29,14,What references to alcohol are there,"The narrator, Jackie, had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days. Seven hundred and thirty days ago, Jackie and Perry had gotten into a car accident that almost killed the two because Jackie had been driving after drinking Bacardi Limon.

Jackie saw a translucent memmory of her dad sitting motionless at a table with an empty glass of Apple-Schnapple and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Jackie also remembered he father giving her beer as a child and her mother ignoring this.

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

Finally, at the end of the story, Jackie licked the cracks on her lips as her eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on her tongue. She felt herself drift, which she thought a good thing, because she needed the rest.","1. The answer to your question is not in the provided text.

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","0.5
Question: What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?
Text document: for question-answering systems to precisely locate
answers, while document-lev el indexing is more
appropriate for summarizing documents to understand their main concepts and ideas.
Query Manipulation After indexing, query manipulation is performed to adjust user queries for
accurate retrieval of information. The specificity
of indexing depends on the task and data type. For example, sentence-level indexing is beneficial
for question-answering systems to precisely locate answers, while document-level indexing is more appropriate for summarizing documents to understand their main concepts and ideas.
