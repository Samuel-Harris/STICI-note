3,1,What monsters are encountered in this journey?,"Ropers, kobolds, kobold inventors, fire giants, and fire giant dreadnoughts.","

4,2,What framework was chosen to execute the RAG process and what alternatives were considered?,The LangChain framework was used to orchestrate the RAG process. Llamaindex and LitGPT were also considered during development. Llmware was considered after development had finished.,"
The framework chosen for executing the RAG process was LLM, which stands for Language Model. It is a powerful and well-supported framework that allows you to build models with small models (less than 100K parameters) using PyTorch or TensorFlow. The advantage of LLM over other frameworks like BERT is its ability to handle long sequences, making it ideal for tasks like language modeling, question answering, and natural language processing. LLM also has a large community of developers who have contributed to the framework, which makes it easy to integrate with existing systems and tools. In my case, I chose LLM because it was already available on my laptop, and I didn't want to spend time building a new framework from scratch."

The parameters for the mo.ui.text function are:
- placeholder: a string that will be displayed as the placeholder text when the user types in the UI element.
- value: the actual text that will be displayed on the UI element.

To get the value of an UI element, you can use its .value property. In your case, you're using the mo.ui.text() function to create a UI element with a placeholder text and a value. You can then access the value by calling the .value property on the created UI element."

12,6,What are the risk classifications for AI?,"The risk classifications are: ""minimal risk"", ""high-risk"", ""unacceptable risk"", and ""specific transparency risk""","
The Commission proposes a risk–based approach, with four levels of risk for AI systems, as well as an identification of risk specific to general purpose models:

How do I know whether an AI system is high-risk?
To get together with a clear definition of ‘high-risk', the Act sets out a solid methodology that helps identifying high-risk AI systems within the legal framework. This aims to provide legal certainty for businesses and other operators.

Narrow procedural tasks, improve the result of previous human activities, do not influence human decisions or do purely preparatory tasks are not considered high-risk. However, an AI system shall always be considered high-risk if it performs profiling of natural persons.

Right to privacy and data protection rights), are considered to be high-risk. Annexe to the Act is the list of high-risk AI systems, which can be reviewed to align with the evolution of AI use cases."
13,6,What are the rules for developing general purpose AI models?,"General purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks. 12 months after the AI Act enters into force, the obligations for general purpose AI governance become applicable. Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.","
The AI Office will enforce and supervise the new rules for general purpose AI models. This includes drawing up codes of practice to detail out rules, its role in classifying models with systemic risk, and monitoring the effective implementation and compliance with the Regulation. The European AI Office will engage with the Commission to draw up Code of Conducts as a central tool to detail out the rules in cooperation with other expert groups. A scientific panel will play a central role in overseeing general-purpose AI models."

The self-attention mechanism is a transformer architecture that allows the model to attend over multiple time steps and learn to predict the next token based on the previous tokens. The attention mechanism is implemented using a matrix multiplication between the query and key vectors, followed by a softmax function to normalize the output.

Let’s look at how we can implement this in our code.

First, let’s define the self-attention layer:
```python
class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim_q, dim_k, dim_v, num_heads=1, dropout=0.):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.dim_q = dim_q
        self.dim_k = dim_k
        self.dim_v = dim_v
        self.wq = nn.Linear(dim_q, dim_k)
        self.wk = nn.Linear(dim_k, dim_v)
        self.wv = nn.Linear(dim_v, dim_q)
        self.dropout = dropout
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)
    
    def forward(self, query, key, value):
        batch_size = query.shape[0]
        q = self.wq(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.dim_k)
        k = self.wk(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.dim_k)
        v = self.wv(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.dim_v)
        
        attn = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1))
        attn = F.softmax(attn, dim=-1)
        out = torch.matmul(attn, v)
        out = self.dropout(out)
        out = out.view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, value.shape[-2]) + value
        
        return out
```

Now let’s define the attention loss function:
```python
def compute_attention_loss(output, target):
    batch_size = output.shape[0]
    
    # Calculate the attention weights for each token in the output and target
    attn_weights = F.softmax(output, dim=-1)
    
    # Calculate the loss by multiplying the attention weights with the target tokens
    loss = torch.sum(attn_weights * target, dim=1)
    
    return loss
```

Now let’s define the training loop:
```python
def train(model, optimizer, criterion, train_loader, num_epochs):
    model.train()
    losses = []
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        
        for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
            inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)
            
            # Calculate the loss and update the model parameters
            output = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(output, targets)
            losses.append(loss.item())
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            running_loss += loss.item()
            
        print(""Epoch: {}/{}, Loss: {:.4f}"".format(epoch+1, num_epochs, running_loss/len(train_loader)))
        
    return losses
```

Now let’s define the testing loop:
```python
def test(model, criterion, test_loader):
    model.eval()
    
    test_loss = 0.0
    correct = 0
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for inputs, targets in test_loader:
            inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)
            
            output = model(inputs)
            test_loss += criterion(output, targets).item() # Add batch loss to total loss
            
            pred = output.argmax(dim=1, keepdim=True) # Get the index of the max log-probability
            correct += pred.eq(targets.view_as(pred)).sum().item() # Count number of correct predictions
    
    test_loss /= len(test_loader.dataset)
    print(""Test set: Accuracy: {}/{} ({:.2f}%)\n"".format(correct, len(test_loader.dataset), 100 * correct / len(test_loader.dataset)))
```

Now let’s define the main function:
```python
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    
    parser.add_argument(""--data"", type=str, default=""./data/wiki.train.txt"")
    parser.add_argument(""--model"", type=str, default=""transformer"")
    parser.add_argument(""--batch-size"", type=int, default=128)
    parser.add_argument(""--epochs"", type=int, default=50)
    parser.add_argument(""--lr"", type=float, default=0.001)
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    train(model, optimizer, criterion, train_loader, num_epochs=args.epochs)
    test(model, criterion, test_loader)
```

Now let’s run the training and testing loops:
```python
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

And that's it! You should now have a working self-attention implementation in Python using PyTorch."

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","

While traditional retrieval methods, such as the BM25 algorithm (HaNCcok-Beaulieu et al., 1996), focus on term frequency and presence for document complexity, clearly delineating specific problems it addresses. This allows for a clear identification of areas ripe for further optimization and improvement. Despite thorough investigation, the rapid evolution of the field, and BM25 algorithm (HaNCcok-Beaulieu et al., 1996), focus on term frequency and presence for document ranking, they often overlook the semantic information of queries. Current strategies leverage pre-trained LMs like BEERT (Devlin et al., 2019), which can dynamically incorporate fresh information via traditional retrieval methods or pre-train LMs, without the need to directly fine-tune.
