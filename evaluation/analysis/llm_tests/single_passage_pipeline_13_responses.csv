18,9,What is the meaning behind the infrared scenes?,"The significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the Polish family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.","1.
