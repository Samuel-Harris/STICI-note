9,4,When might I use caching?,"You might use caching when, for example, your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings."," The answer to your question is in the provided text. You might use caching when you have expensive intermediate computations, such as t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings that are exposed as UI elements and need to be computed only once for a given set of parameters. Caching these values can save time by avoiding recomputation whenever the same parameters are used again.

To cache function outputs using functools in Python, you can use the `lru_cache` decorator:

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # Set maxsize to None for unlimited caching
def compute_predictions(problem_parameters):
    # Your computation logic here
    return predictions
```"

In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent of the `|>` operator used in Gleam; instead, you can achieve similar functionality using lambda functions or chaining function calls."
26,13,Why are the top-right values in the raw attention weights set to negative infinity?,A mask of negative infinity is applied to the upper right entries of the raw attention weights to ensure they will zero out after softmax.," The answer to your question is in the provided text. In the context, it mentions that ""if we create an array of zeros with -inf in the upper right entries and then perform row-wise softmax we get the desired attention weights."" This implies that setting the top-right values in the raw attention weights to negative infinity helps achieve the desired attention weights when performing a row-wise softmax operation."
27,13,How can I freeze a variable during training in MLX?,"To freeze an attribute during training, you can add '_' as a prefix to the attribute name, which signals to mlx that it is not a parameter and should not be updated during training."," The answer to your question is not in the provided text. However, based on general knowledge about MLX and similar frameworks like PyTorch, freezing a variable during training typically involves preventing certain model parameters from being updated. This can be achieved by setting their gradients to zero before each optimization step or using specific methods provided by the framework that allow you to freeze layers or parameters. Since the text does not directly mention how to freeze variables in MLX, I recommend referring to MLX's official documentation for detailed instructions on parameter management and training procedures."
