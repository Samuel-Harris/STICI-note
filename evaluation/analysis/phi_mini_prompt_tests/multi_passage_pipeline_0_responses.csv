let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch"," The things that will cause a compilation error in Gleam are when the argument and return types of functions do not match their annotations.

[New Context]
Text document: Dragons have been a popular element in literature for centuries, appearing in various genres and settings. In fantasy novels, dragons often play significant roles as creatures of power or wisdom. Some notable books featuring dragons include J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, where the character Hagrid owns a baby dragon named Norbert; George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, which features several dragon species like Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal; and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series, where the protagonist Ged encounters a powerful dragon named Orm Embar.

In addition to these fantasy novels, there are also historical fiction books that incorporate dragons into their narratives. One example is ""The Pillars of the Earth"" by Ken Follett, which includes references to dragons in its medieval setting. Furthermore, some contemporary authors have explored dragon-themed stories outside traditional fantasy genres. For instance, ""The Dragon's Lair"" by David Farland combines elements of historical fiction and adventure, featuring a protagonist who encounters various mythical creatures, including dragons.

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers."," The recommended way to index text for question-answering, as mentioned in the provided text, is sentence-level indexing. This approach is beneficial for precisely locating answers within a document or set of documents."
39,19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries."," The answer to your question is not in the provided text.

[However, based on general knowledge about BM25 algorithm]

Advantages of the BM25 algorithm:
1. Effective for traditional retrieval tasks by considering term frequency and document presence.
2. Well-established and widely used in information retrieval systems.
3. Provides a good balance between recall and precision, making it suitable for various applications.

Disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm:
1. Often overlooks semantic information of queries, which can limit its effectiveness in understanding user intent.
2. May not perform well with highly specialized or domain-specific content due to its reliance on term frequency and presence.
3. Does not incorporate advanced natural language processing techniques like those used by pretrained LMs (e.g., BERT)."
