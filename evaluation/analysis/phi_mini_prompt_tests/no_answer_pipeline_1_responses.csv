8,4,How can I create graphs?,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.," The answer to your question is not in the provided text.

== Answer ==
To create graphs, you would typically use a library or tool designed for data visualization such as Matplotlib in Python:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 15, 7, 10]

plt.plot(x, y)

pltshift_title('Sample Graph')
plt.show()
```"

22,11,Which TPU is recommended?,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.," The answer to your question is not in the provided text.

Text document: TPUs can reuse much more memory with each transfer from global memory, which makes them a little bit more efficient at matrix multiplications than GPUs. Having larger tiles means we can reuse more memory. I wrote about this in detail in my TPU vs GPU blog post. In fact, you can see TPUs as having very, very, large tiles for each Tensor Core. As such, TPUs can reuse much more memory with each transfer from global memory, which makes them a little

We can see that the RTX 4070 Ti is most cost-effective for 8-bit and 16-bit inference while the RTX 3080 remains most cost_effective for 16-bit training. While these GPUs are most cost-effective, they are not necessarily recommended as they do not have sufficient memory for many use-cases. However,

If I would build a small cluster for a company/academic lab, I would use 66-80% A6000 GPUs and 20-33% H100 SXM GPUs. If I get a good deal on L40 GPUs, I would also pick them instead of A6000, so you can always ask for a quote on these.

Note: Although TPUs are mentioned in the document, there's no specific recommendation about which type or model of TPU should be used as it doesn't provide that information."

24,12,What does the ++ operator do in Gleam?,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.," In Gleam, the ++ operator is used to concatenate two values. Specifically, it takes both values as strings and combines them into a single string. The correct usage in Gleam for this operation is shown with ""Concatenate"" followed by ""+"", which corresponds to ""<>"" when referring to the actual operator symbol."

26,13,How many parameters does the transformer model have?,The answer to your question is not in the provided text.," The answer to your question is not in the provided text.
Text document: These are the parameters we will use for training (you can play around with this):

We also add 2 lines of code in the constructor to print the total number of params. Finally, we are ready to build the training loop.

Training Loop
To train the model we need a loss function. Since we are predicting classes (next token) we use cross-entropy loss.

self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_emb, vocab_size) # output projection
        self._init_parameters() # <-- initialize params
        # print total number of params on initialization
        total_params = sum([p.size for p in utils.tree_flatten(self.parameters())])

def _init_parameters(self):
        normal_init = nn.init.normal(mean=0.0, std=0.02)
        residual_init = nn Written by: [Your Name]
Date: [Current Date]

The provided text document outlines the process of initializing a transformer model and printing its total number of parameters during initialization. However, it does not explicitly state the exact number of parameters for the transformer model in question. The calculation method is described using Python code that sums up the sizes of all parameters (`p.size` for each parameter `p`) obtained from flattening the model's parameters tree structure.

To determine the specific number of parameters, one would need to execute this initialization process and print out the result as per the provided instructions in the text document. Since we cannot perform code execution here, I can only confirm that the answer is not present directly within the given text."
