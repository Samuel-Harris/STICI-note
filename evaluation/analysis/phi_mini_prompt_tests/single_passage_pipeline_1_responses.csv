9,4,When might I use caching?,"You might use caching when, for example, your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings."," The answer to your question is not in the provided text.
support: Caching can be used when you have a function that performs expensive computations and it's likely to be called multiple times with the same inputs. By caching the results, subsequent calls with the same input will return instantly from the cache instead of recomputing the result, which saves time and resources. This is particularly useful in scenarios like web applications where certain data might need to be fetched repeatedly or when running complex algorithms that take a significant amount of processing power.

Here's an example using functools:

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # Cache all calls, no limit on cache size
def expensive_computation(x):
    # Simulate a time-consuming computation
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    return x * x
```

In this example, the `expensive_computation` function is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache`, which caches its results based on the input arguments. The first call to `expensive_computation(x)` will perform the computation and store the result in cache. Subsequent calls with the same argument `x` will return instantly from the cache, without recomputing the value."

11,5,Do I have to do something all by myself to be acknowledged for it?,"You don’t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it.

12,6,What kinds of models would need to be officially registered?,"High-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration.

13,6,"What kinds of AI carry ""systematic risks""?","For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model)."," AI systems that perform profiling of natural persons are considered high-risk. Additionally, the text mentions general-purpose AI models, including large generative AI models, which could carry systemic risks if they are used for a variety of tasks and become the basis for many AI systems in the EU."

Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions.
