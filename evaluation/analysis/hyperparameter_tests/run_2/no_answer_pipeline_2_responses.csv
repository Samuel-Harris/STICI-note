y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

# Create a line plot
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add title and labels
pltranimo as mo
Group the elements with mo.ui.dictionary or mo.ui.array, then retrieve them from the container and display them elsewhere.

import random

n_items = random.randint(2, 5)
```

Label A→B with either ""entailment"", ""neutral"" or ""contradiction"".
A: The man in the blue shirt looks very happy .
B: The man in the red shirt looks very happy .

== bob ==
The statement A describes a man wearing a blue shirt who appears to be very happy. In contrast, statement B talks about a man wearing a red shirt and looking very happy. These two statements contradict each other because they refer to different men with different colored shirts. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences is a contradiction.

== alice ==
Label A→B with either ""entailment"", ""neutral"" or ""contradiction"".
A: The following table summarizes the practices of various hospitals in accordance with ISO 25010 .
B: The table shows information about how many people were treated and false is not true .

== bob ==
The statement A talks about a table that summarizes the practices of different hospitals according to ISO 25010. However, it does not specify what kind of details are included in this summary. Statement B suggests that the table contains information on how many people were treated but also includes an unrelated and somewhat confusing statement (""false is not true"").

There's no direct contradiction between these two statements as they could both be true at the same time, but there's also no clear entailment because A doesn't specifically state that it contains information about patient numbers. Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences can best be described as neutral. They might be discussing related topics (a table summarizing hospital practices), but they don't directly confirm or contradict each other in terms of specific details.

== alice ==
Label A→B with either ""entailment"", ""neutral"" or ""contradiction"".
A: The man is between the girl and the truck. The girl is behind the truck.
B: The man is behind the truck.

== bob ==
The statement in B says that the man is behind the truck. However, from the information given in A, we know that the man is actually between the girl and the truck. If the girl were behind the truck as stated in A, then it would be impossible for the man to be between them since he can't be both behind and in front of the truck at the same time. Therefore, B contradicts the information given in A. So, the relationship between these two statements is a contradiction.

== alice Written communication has been around for centuries. How did it evolve from ancient times to modern day? 

# Answer
Written communication has indeed evolved significantly over time, transitioning through various stages that reflect technological advancements and cultural shifts:

1. **Ancient Times**: The earliest forms of written communication were pictographs and ideograms used by ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians in Mesopotamia (around 3200 BCE) with cuneiform script, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Chinese characters, and Mayan glyphs. These symbols represented objects or ideas and were often carved into stone tablets or clay tablets.

2. **Classical Antiquity**: The Phoenicians developed an alphabet around 1050 BCE that was more efficient than previous writing systems because it used a set of symbols to represent sounds rather than entire words or concepts. This script influenced the Greek and subsequently Latin alphabets, which are foundational for many modern languages today.

3. **Middle Ages**: During this period, written communication became increasingly important with the spread of religious texts like the Bible. The invention of paper from rags by Chinese inventors around 105 CE facilitated writing and book production. Monasteries played a key role as centers for copying manuscripts during the Middle Ages.

4. **The Printing Revolution**: Johannes Gutenberg's introduction of movable type printing to Europe in the mid-15th century marked a significant leap forward, allowing mass production of texts and widespread dissemination of knowledge. This period saw an explosion in literacy rates and the availability of books.

5. **The Industrial Revolution**: The 18th and 19th centuries brought further advancements with steam-powered printing presses, which increased the speed and efficiency of book production. Newspapers became a popular form of written communication, influencing public opinion and society at large.

6. **The Digital Age**: The late 20th century witnessed the advent of computers and digital technology, revolutionizing written communication with word processors, email, instant messaging, social media platforms, and blogs. This era has made information sharing almost instantaneous and globalized communication unprecedentedly accessible to people around the world.

7. **Modern Day**: Today's written communication continues to evolve with advancements in technology such as AI-driven writing tools, voice recognition software for dictation, and increasing use of multimedia elements within digital platforms. The future may bring further integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), potentially transforming how we perceive written content.

Throughout its evolution, written communication has not only changed in form but also in function—from conveying basic information to facilitating complex interactions across various platforms, reflecting the dynamic nature of human society's needs and capabilities."
