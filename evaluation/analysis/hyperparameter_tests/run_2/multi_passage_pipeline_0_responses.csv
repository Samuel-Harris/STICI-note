What happens to the temperature of a cookie as it bakes in an oven?

# Answer
As a cookie bakes in an oven, its temperature increases due to the heat transfer from the oven's heating elements to the dough. Initially, when the cookie is placed into the oven, the surface begins to warm up quickly as it comes into direct contact with the hot air and surfaces inside the oven.

The rate of temperature increase will depend on several factors:

1. **Oven Temperature**: The higher the oven's set temperature, the faster the cookie will bake. Most cookies are typically baked at temperatures ranging from 325°F to 375°F (about 160°C to 190°C).

2. **Cookie Thickness**: A thicker cookie will take longer to reach the desired internal temperature compared to a thin one because heat must travel through more material before reaching the center of the cookie.

3. **Moisture Content**: Cookies with higher moisture content may bake at different rates since water absorbs heat and can affect how quickly the cookie dries out and sets.

4. **Insulation Properties**: The type of pan used (e.g., dark, non-stick, or metal) also influences how evenly and quickly the cookie heats up due to differences in thermal conductivity.

5. **Baking Time**: As time passes, the temperature gradient within the cookie will decrease as it approaches its final baked state, with the center getting closer to the desired internal temperature (usually around 200°F or 93°C for a fully cooked cookie). The surface of the cookie may start to brown and crisp up due to Maillard reactions.

Throughout the baking process, heat continues to transfer from the oven's interior to the cookie until it reaches its final temperature, which is typically uniform throughout if the oven has good circulation and the cookie is evenly shaped. The precise internal temperature of a fully baked cookie can vary depending on the recipe but generally ranges between 200°F (93°C) to 210°F (99°C)."

### Response: The answer to your question is not in the provided text.

However, based on the information given in the document, we can infer that there are four levels of risk for AI systems as proposed by the Commission and high-risk AI systems include performing profiling of natural persons and involvement of certain rights. For a detailed list or breakdown of these risk classifications, further information would be needed.

If you're looking for more specific details on the four levels of risk, please provide additional context or ask another question related to this topic.

Alternatively, here is an example of how AI systems can generally be categorized into different risk levels:

1. Low Risk: AI systems that perform narrow procedural tasks, improve previous human activities without influencing decisions, and do purely preparatory tasks are considered low-risk.
2. Medium Risk: AI systems involved in moderate decision-making processes or those affecting a limited number of individuals may fall under medium risk.
3. High Risk: AI systems that perform profiling of natural persons, involve certain rights, and have significant impact on human decisions are considered high-risk.

37,18,Which books contain multiple narratives?,"The books 'Same Bed Different Dreams', 'EVERY DROP IS A MAN’S NIGHTMARE', 'The Museum of Human History', 'Witch King', and 'The Terraformers' each use multiple narratives.","
The books that contain multiple narratives are not mentioned in the provided text.
===
The answer to your question is not in the provided text.

However, based on the context given within the text document, it suggests a book with multiple intertwined timelines and different story threads involving characters like Kai, a Black Korean War vet, and a has-been writer working for GLOAT. Although specific titles are not mentioned, this description implies that such books likely contain multiple narratives. To identify the exact titles of these books, additional information would be required beyond what is provided in the text document.

If you have any more details or context about the book's content, I can try to help further with my knowledge up to a certain date. Otherwise, for specific title identification, please provide that information directly."
38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","
The recommended way to index text for question-answering is sentence-level indexing.
===
The recommended way to index text for question-answering, as mentioned in the provided text document, is sentence-level indexing. This approach is beneficial for question-answering systems to precisely locate answers. Sentence-level indexing allows these systems to focus on individual sentences within a larger context, making it easier to find relevant information that directly addresses specific queries.

The text also mentions other forms of indexing such as document-level indexing and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), but for the purpose of question-answering, sentence-level indexing is recommended according to the provided information."
39,19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries.","
The text document does not provide specific advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm. However, it mentions that BM25 is a cost-effective alternative to extensive training and fine-tuning processes typically required for LLMs (Large Language Models). It also allows for dynamic incorporation of fresh information via traditional retrieval methods or pre-trained LMs without directly involving LLMs.

The answer to your question is not in the provided text. However, generally speaking, BM25 has several advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:
1. Effective for ranking documents based on relevance to a given query.
2. Can handle sparse data effectively due to its probabilistic nature.
3. Works well with large datasets as it is computationally efficient.
4. Robust against variations in document length and term frequency.
5. Allows dynamic incorporation of fresh information without extensive retraining.

Disadvantages:
1. May not perform well on highly specialized or domain-specific queries.
2. Requires careful tuning of parameters to achieve optimal performance.
3. Can be sensitive to the choice of stop words and document length normalization methods.
4. Does not account for query expansion, which may limit its effectiveness in certain scenarios.
5. May struggle with semantic understanding and context beyond term frequency analysis.

Note: The specific advantages and disadvantages mentioned above are based on general knowledge about the BM25 algorithm and might not be explicitly stated in the provided text document.
