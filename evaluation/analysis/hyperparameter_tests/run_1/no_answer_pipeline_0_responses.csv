Text document: GPU acceleration on my MacBook. These architectures are very interesting, and I would love to try them out, but for this project, I will have to settle for a more tried-and-tested approach.

two main reasons. Firstly, I have concerns about the performance. These architectures are in their infancy, and I do not expect them to outperform equivalently-sized traditional transformers. Secondly, as these architectures are very new and experimental, I do not expect much support for them,

The final optimisation technique that I considered, AirLLM, is quite different from the others in that instead of optimising the model weights, it optimises the model inference. Typically, LLMs are loaded onto the GPU in their entirety, requiring a lot of VRAM to run the larger, better-performing
