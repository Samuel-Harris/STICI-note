0,0,Which enemy types wield an AK-47?,Assault-rifle wielding Bullet and Tankers wield AK-47s.,"
The AI does not have the capability to know the specific enemy types wield an AK-47. However, in the provided text, it is mentioned that the player encounters Bandana Bullet Kin, which are described as having a higher magazine size than regular Bullet Kin and firing four slithering lines of bullet at the player from under their hoods. This suggests that they may be enemies that use an AK-47 or other similar weaponry."
1,0,What makes jammed enemies different?,"Jammed Keybullet Kin drop 2 keys instead of 1, jammed Chance Kins have a chance to drop twice the loot, and jammed red-Caped Bullet Kin deal contact damage. Additionally, Jammed Keybullet Kin Jammed variations run faster and will take less time to teleport away from the player if they are not destroyed quickly.","
Jammed enemies are enemies that have been damaged or destroyed by the player, but still remain in the game world. This means that they can still move and attack the player, even if they are not fully destroyed. Jammed enemies are often used as a way to create challenging situations for players, such as forcing them to use different tactics or strategies to defeat them. They can also be used to add an element of surprise or danger to the gameplay, making it more exciting and engaging for players."

8,4,What are the ways of grouping UI elements together?,"UI elements can be grouped together using the following methods:
- Create an array of UI elements.
- Create a dictionary of UI elements.
- Embed a dynamic number of UI elements in another output.
- Create a hstack (or vstack) of UI elements with on_change handlers.
- Create a table column of buttons with on_change handlers
- Create a form with multiple UI elements.","
There are several ways to group UI elements together:

1. Using a dictionary or list of UI elements: You can create a dictionary or list of UI elements and use it to group them together. For example, you could have a dictionary with the following keys:

```python
{
    ""header"": mo.ui.label(""Header""),
    ""description"": mo.ui.text(""Description""),
    ""button1"": mo.ui.button(""Button 1""),
    ""button2"": mo.ui.button(""Button 2"")
}
```

And then use this dictionary to group the UI elements together:

```python
import random

form = mo.form(title=""My Form"", fields=[
    mo.field(label=""Header""),
    mo.field(label=""Description""),
    mo.field(type=""button"", label=""Button 1""),
    mo.field(type=""button"", label=""Button 2"")
])

for i in range(5):
    form.fields[i].value = ""Value {}"".format(i)

form.submit()
```

In this example, the `form` object is created with a dictionary of UI elements as its fields. The `submit()` method submits the form and waits for it to be processed by the server.

2. Using a list of UI elements: You can also create a list of UI elements and use it to group them together. For example, you could have a list with the following items:

```python
[mo.ui.label(""Header""), mo.ui.text(""Description""), mo.ui.button(""Button 1""), mo.ui.button(""Button 2"")]
```

And then use this list to group the UI elements together:

```python
import random

form = mo.form(title=""My Form"", fields=[
    mo.field(label=""Header""),
    mo.field(label=""Description""),
    mo.field(type=""button"", label=""Button 1""),
    mo.field(type=""button"", label=""Button 2"")
])

for i in range(5):
    form.fields[i].value = ""Value {}"".format(i)

form.submit()
```

In this example, the `form` object is created with a list of UI elements as its fields. The `submit()` method submits the form and waits for it to be processed by the server.

3. Using a function: You can also create a function that takes an array or list of UI elements as input and returns a dictionary or list of UI elements, based on the keys in the input array/list. For example, you could have a function like this:

```python
def group_ui_elements(ui_elements):
    return {
        ""header"": mo.ui.label(""Header""),
        ""description"": mo.ui.text(""Description""),
        ""button1"": mo.ui.button(""Button 1""),
        ""button2"": mo.ui.button(""Button 2"")
    }
```

And then use this function to group the UI elements together:

```python
import random

form = mo.form(title=""My Form"", fields=[
    mo.field(label=""Header""),
    mo.field(label=""Description""),
    mo.field(type=""button"", label=""Button 1""),
    mo.field(type=""button"", label=""Button 2"")
])

for i in range(5):
    form.fields[i].value = ""Value {}"".format(i)

form.submit()
```

In this example, the `group_ui_elements()` function is called with an array of UI elements as input. The resulting dictionary or list of UI elements is then used to group the UI elements together."
9,4,What are the parameters for the mo.ui.text function?,The parameters for mo.ui.text are label and placeholder. These are both optional.,"
The `mo.ui.text` function takes the following parameters:

- `placeholder`: The placeholder text to display when the user types into the input field. This parameter is optional and defaults to an empty string.
- `value`: The initial value of the input field. This parameter is required and must be a valid Python object (e.g., a string, integer, float, or boolean).
- `min_length`: The minimum length of the input field before it becomes required. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0.
- `max_length`: The maximum length of the input field before it becomes required. This parameter is optional and defaults to None (i.e., no maximum length).
- `required`: Whether or not the input field should be required for submission. This parameter is optional and defaults to False.
- `placeholder_text`: A placeholder text that will display when the user types into the input field. This parameter is optional and defaults to an empty string.
- `value_on_focus`: The initial value of the input field when it receives focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to None (i.e., no initial value).
- `min_length_on_focus`: The minimum length of the input field when it receives focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0.
- `max_length_on_focus`: The maximum length of the input field when it receives focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to None (i.e., no maximum length).
- `required_on_focus`: Whether or not the input field should be required for submission when it receives focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to False.
- `placeholder_text_on_focus`: A placeholder text that will display when the user types into the input field when it receives focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to an empty string.
- `value_on_blur`: The initial value of the input field when it loses focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to None (i.e., no initial value).
- `min_length_on_blur`: The minimum length of the input field when it loses focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to 0.
- `max_length_on_blur`: The maximum length of the input field when it loses focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to None (i.e., no maximum length).
- `required_on_blur`: Whether or not the input field should be required for submission when it loses focus. This parameter is optional and defaults to False.

You can pass these parameters to the `mo.ui.text` function as follows:

```python
import mo

form = mo.form({
    ""name"": mo.ui.text(placeholder=""Your name"", value=""John Doe""),
    ""email"": mo.ui.text(placeholder=""Your email address"", min_length=5, max_length=100),
    ""password"": mo.ui.text(placeholder=""Your password"", required=True),
})
```"
10,5,What are the given examples of common challenges?,"The given examples of common challenges are: ""you create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it""; ""you ran an experiment but nobody is using the results""; ""you built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it""; and ""you created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it"".","
Here are some examples of common chaullenges:

1. The project is not aligned with the company's goals or values
2. The project team is not skilled enough to deliver the expected results
3. The project scope has changed since it was initially defined
4. The project timeline is too tight, and the project team cannot meet it
5. The project budget is too high, and the project team cannot deliver the results within the budget
6. The project is not well-communicated to stakeholders
7. The project is not well-planned or executed
8. The project is not monitored regularly enough to ensure progress is being made towards its goals

11,5,What are the four steps to become more impact-focused?,"The four steps to become more impact-focused are: ""Step 1: Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly"", ""Step 2: Ensure your work solves a real business problem"", ""Step 3: Ensure there is buy-in for your work"", and ""Step 4: Focus your time on the highest-impact thing"".","
Sure, here are the four steps to become more impact-focus:

1. Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly.
2. Stop thinking about productivity metrics like ""I launched 5 experiments"" or ""I built this model."" Hold yourself accountable to driving impact.
3. Focus your time on the highest-impact thing. No matter what role you're in, you're likely juggling multiple priorities. To maximize your impact, you need to ensure you spend the majority of your time on the most important thing.
4. Step up and prioritize impact. This means leaving it to your manager to worry about impact. But stepping up comes with some real benefits for your career:

- Increased job satisfaction and engagement
- Better alignment with company values and mission
- Greater opportunities for growth and advancement
- More effective communication with stakeholders and customers

Remember, becoming more impact-focused takes time and effort. But the benefits are worth it!"
12,6,What are the risk classifications for AI?,"The risk classifications are: ""minimal risk"", ""high-risk"", ""unacceptable risk"", and ""specific transparency risk""","
The Commission proposes a risk–based approach, with four levels of risk for AI systems:

1. Low-risk: The system is designed to perform its intended function and does not pose significant risks to human health or safety.
2. Medium-risk: The system poses some risks to human health or safety but is unlikely to cause significant harm.
3. High-risk: The system poses a high risk of causing significant harm to human health or safety, and the potential consequences are likely to be severe.
4. Very high-risk: The system poses an extremely high risk of causing significant harm to human health or safety, and the potential consequences are likely to be catastrophic.

The Commission also proposes a risk classification for general purpose AI models, which are not specifically designed for specific applications but can be used in various contexts. These models are classified as follows:

1. Low-risk: The model does not pose significant risks to human health or safety and is unlikely to cause significant harm.
2. Medium-risk: The model poses some risks to human health or safety but is unlikely to cause significant harm.
3. High-risk: The model poses a high risk of causing significant harm to human health or safety, and the potential consequences are likely to be severe.
4. Very high-risk: The model poses an extremely high risk of causing significant harm to human health or safety, and the potential consequences are likely to be catastrophic."
13,6,What are the rules for developing general purpose AI models?,"General purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks. 12 months after the AI Act enters into force, the obligations for general purpose AI governance become applicable. Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.","
The rules for developing general-purpose AI models are complex and vary depending on the specific model being developed. However, some common requirements include:

1. Registration with the UK's Data Protection Authority (DPA) to ensure that the model is safe and secure.

2. Clearly documenting the model's design, including its inputs, outputs, and any assumptions made about the data.

3. Ensuring that the model is capable of performing its intended function accurately and efficiently.

4. Providing clear documentation on how the model works, including its architecture, training data, and evaluation metrics.

5. Regularly updating the model to address any new or emerging threats or vulnerabilities.

6. Ensuring that the model is subjected to rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure its safety and reliability.

7. Providing clear information on how the model will be used, including any potential risks or consequences of using it.

8. Developing a risk assessment plan to identify and mitigate any potential risks associated with the model.

9. Ensuring that the model is designed to operate within the boundaries of its intended use case and does not pose a significant risk to human life, health, or property.

10. Regularly monitoring and updating the model's performance to ensure it remains safe and effective over time.

Overall, developing general-purpose AI models requires careful planning, testing, and regulatory compliance to ensure that they are safe, secure, and effective for their intended use case."

25,12,What things will cause a compilation error in Gleam?,"In Gleam, let and = can be used for pattern matching, but you’ll get compile errors if there’s a type mismatch. Functions can optionally have their argument and return types annotated in Gleam. These type annotations will always be checked by the compiler and throw a compilation error if not valid.

The following code will also throw a compilation error:
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch","
In GleaM, there are several things that can cause a compilation error:

1. Incorrect type annotations: If the types of arguments and return values in a function are not correctly annotated, the compiler will throw a compilation error. For example, if you try to call a function with an argument of type float and a return value of type int, the compiler will complain that the return value is not an integer.

2. Unsupported operations: GlemaM does not support all operations that are supported by other programming languages. For example, it does not support some mathematical operators like +, -, *, /, and ^.

3. Incorrect usage of functions: If you use a function incorrectly or with the wrong arguments, the compiler will also throw a compilation error. For example, if you try to call a function that takes an argument of type int but expects a float as return value, the compiler will complain that the argument is not an integer.

4. Incorrect usage of operators: If you use an operator incorrectly or with the wrong arguments, the compiler will also throw a compilation error. For example, if you try to add two integers using the + operator but expect a float as return value, the compiler will complain that the argument is not an integer.

5. Incorrect usage of functions: If you use a function incorrectly or with the wrong arguments, the compiler will also throw a compilation error. For example, if you try to call a function that takes an argument of type float but expects a string as return value, the compiler will complain that the argument is not a float.

6. Incorrect usage of types: If you use a type incorrectly or with the wrong arguments, the compiler will also throw a compilation error. For example, if you try to call a function that takes an argument of type int but expects a string as return value, the compiler will complain that the argument is not a float.

7. Incorrect usage of functions: If you use a function incorrectly or with the wrong arguments, the compiler will also throw a compilation error.

26,13,Where is broadcasting used?,"Broadcasting is used to do the < comparision between the column vector [0, 1, 2, 3] and the row vector [0, 1, 2, 3], which is one of the steps to make a causal language modelling mask. Broadcasting is also used to add pos_emb and tok_emb elementwise to get the new representations of the tokens with positional information.","
Broadcasting is a technique used in numerical computation to distribute data across multiple processors or cores. In TensorFlow, broadcasting is used to distribute the values of a tensor across multiple devices (processors) in parallel. This allows for efficient computation on large datasets that would otherwise be too large to fit into memory on a single device. Broadcasting is particularly useful when working with tensors that have different shapes or dimensions, as it allows for data to be distributed across multiple devices without losing any information."

She also remembered that she had almost killed her brother, Perry, seven hundred and thirty days ago in a car accident, when she actually did kill her brother in that accident.","
In the conversation, Jackie remembers differently to what she saw because she was venomoous and had a different perspective on her situation. She remembered that she was in a car with her brother, but she also remembered that she was being chased by someone who was driving a car. This difference in perspective allowed her to see things from a different angle and come up with a more complex explanation for what happened."
29,14,What references to alcohol are there,"The narrator, Jackie, had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days. Seven hundred and thirty days ago, Jackie and Perry had gotten into a car accident that almost killed the two because Jackie had been driving after drinking Bacardi Limon.

Jackie saw a translucent memmory of her dad sitting motionless at a table with an empty glass of Apple-Schnapple and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Jackie also remembered he father giving her beer as a child and her mother ignoring this.

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

Finally, at the end of the story, Jackie licked the cracks on her lips as her eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on her tongue. She felt herself drift, which she thought a good thing, because she needed the rest.","
Yes, there are several references to alcohol in the conversation between the user and the AI. Here are some examples:

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","
The recommended way to index text for question-answering is to use document-level indexing. This involves creating a set of documents (i.e., sentences or paragraphs) that contain the questions and answers you want to answer. The documents should be well-structured, with clear headings and subheadings, and each sentence should have a unique identifier (i.e., a unique token).

Document-level indexing is more appropriate for question-answering systems because it allows for efficient retrieval of information based on the questions asked. This is because the system can use the document structure to identify the relevant sentences or paragraphs that contain the answers to the questions.

In summary, document-level indexing is recommended for question-answering systems because it allows for efficient retrieval of information based on the questions asked."
39,19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries.","
The BM25 algorithm is a popular retrieval method that has been widely used in search engines and information retrieval applications. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm:

Advantages:
1. High recall rate: The BM25 algorithm can achieve high recall rates, which means it returns relevant documents even when there is a low match between the query and the document.

2. Robust to noise: The BM25 algorithm can handle queries with noise or irrelevant terms, as it considers both the query term and its context in the document.

3. Flexible: The BM25 algorithm allows for customization of the parameters, such as the weighting of different search terms, to meet specific requirements.

4. Easy to implement: The BM25 algorithm is a simple and straightforward algorithm that can be implemented easily in most search engines.

Disadvantages:
1. Complexity: The BM25 algorithm is complex and requires careful tuning of the parameters, which can be time-consuming and difficult for non-experts to implement.

2. Limited applicability: While the BM25 algorithm has been widely used in search engines, it may not be as effective in other applications where the query terms are more complex or the documents have a different structure.

3. Dependence on LMs: The BM25 algorithm relies heavily on pre-trained language models (LMs), which can be prone to overfitting and may not generalize well to new data.

4. Limited applicability in non-English languages: While the BM25 algorithm has been successfully applied in English-language search engines, it may not work as effectively in other languages with different character sets or word order."
