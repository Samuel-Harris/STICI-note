Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.","
The Commission has issued a set of guidelines for developing general-purpose AI models. These guidelines outline the principles and requirements that should be followed when designing, building, and deploying such models. The guidelines cover topics such as data privacy, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

The guidelines also provide a framework for developing general-purpose AI models, including:

1. Identifying the problem: Developers must identify the specific problem that they want to solve with their model. This helps them to understand the requirements of the problem and the data needed to train the model.

2. Designing the model: The design process involves defining the model architecture, selecting the appropriate algorithms, and optimizing the model for performance.

3. Building the model: Developers must build the model using a variety of techniques, including deep learning frameworks, machine learning libraries, and other tools.

4. Deploying the model: Once the model is built, it needs to be deployed in a way that ensures its accuracy, security, and privacy. This may involve deploying the model on a cloud platform or using an AI platform.

5. Monitoring and evaluating the model: Developers must monitor the performance of their models over time and evaluate them based on specific metrics. This helps to ensure that the model is performing as expected and can be used for its intended purpose.

Overall, the guidelines provide a framework for developing general-purpose AI models that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable."

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","
The recommended way to index text for question-answering is through sentence-level indexing. Sentence-level indexing involves breaking down the text into individual sentences and then indexing each sentence separately. This approach allows for more precise location of answers in the text, as it can be easily identified by the sentence level. Additionally, sentence-level indexing can help to reduce the size of the index, making it faster to search through the index. However, depending on the task and data type, other indexing methods may also be used. For example, document-level indexing is more appropriate for text that contains a large number of documents or for tasks where the main concepts and ideas are not well defined. In summary, sentence-level indexing is recommended for question-answering systems as it allows for precise location of answers in the text, reduces index size, and can be used for document-level indexing when appropriate."
39,19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries.","
The BM25 algorithm is a popular retrieval method used in many search engines, including Google. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm:

Advantages:
1. High efficiency: The BM25 algorithm is efficient because it uses a simple formula to calculate the relevance score for each document. This makes it suitable for large-scale search engines that process millions of documents per second.

2. Robustness: The BM25 algorithm is robust, meaning it can handle variations in query terms and document content. This makes it suitable for search engines that deal with a wide range of queries and documents.

3. Flexibility: The BM25 algorithm allows for flexibility in how the relevance score is calculated. This means that different algorithms can be used to rank documents based on different criteria, such as popularity or authority.

Disadvantages:
1. Complexity: The BM25 algorithm is complex and requires a lot of training data to learn. This makes it difficult for search engines to scale up quickly, especially if they need to handle large volumes of queries.

2. Limited applicability: While the BM25 algorithm is widely used in search engines, it is not suitable for all types of documents or queries. For example, it is not suitable for documents with no relevance to the query, such as advertisements or product descriptions.

3. Dependence on training data: The BM25 algorithm requires a lot of training data to learn how to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query. This makes it difficult to adapt to new queries and changes in search behavior.

In summary, while the BM25 algorithm is a popular and effective retrieval method, it has some limitations that should be considered when designing search engines."
