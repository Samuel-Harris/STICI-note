0,0,Which enemy types wield an AK-47?,Assault-rifle wielding Bullet and Tankers wield AK-47s.,"
The AI does not have the capability to provide information about enemy types. However, in this conversation between a user and the AI, the AI is helpful and friendly, and when it does not know the answer it says ""The answer to your question is not in the provided text."". To help answer the question, you can use the following information:

Trivia
Banda√±a Bullet Kin wield Machine Pistols."
1,0,What makes jammed enemies different?,"Jammed Keybullet Kin drop 2 keys instead of 1, jammed Chance Kins have a chance to drop twice the loot, and jammed red-Caped Bullet Kin deal contact damage. Additionally, Jammed Keybullet Kin Jammed variations run faster and will take less time to teleport away from the player if they are not destroyed quickly.","
Jammed enemies are enemies that have been damaged or destroyed, but still move and fire. They can be seen in the game as enemies that have been shot multiple times, causing them to slow down and sometimes even stop moving altogether. This is because they have lost their ability to shoot due to damage or other factors. Jammed enemies can also be seen as enemies that are stuck in a position, unable to move or fire. They may appear to be frozen in place, with no movement or sound. In the game, jammed enemies can be a significant obstacle for players, as they can slow down the player's progress and make it more difficult to complete objectives."
2,1,What enemies are encountered in the second encounter?,26 kobolds and 1 kobold inventor are encountered in the second encounter.,"
The second encounter in the second encounter is a group of four goblins, who are encountered near the entrance to the underground/underdark. They are described as being ""timid"" and ""scavengers,"" which suggests that they may be less aggressive than other enemies encountered in the area."
3,1,What monsters are encountered in this journey?,"Ropers, kobolds, kobold inventors, fire giants, and fire giant dreadnoughts.","
The journey through the underground/underdark is described as being filled with various monsters, including giant worm-like creatures, crystal-covered chambers, and cave-like passages.

4,2,What framework was chosen to execute the RAG process and what alternatives were considered?,The LangChain framework was used to orchestrate the RAG process. Llamaindex and LitGPT were also considered during development. Llmware was considered after development had finished.,"
The AI used in this conversation was trained on a large corpus of text data, including the RAG process. The RAG process is an acronym for ""Reduce and Align Graphs,"" which involves reducing the graph structure of a sentence to a smaller set of nodes that represent the most important information, and then aligning these nodes with the original sentence using a graph-based alignment algorithm.

In this conversation, the AI was trained on a corpus of text data consisting of a large number of sentences from various sources, including news articles, academic papers, and social media posts. The RAG process is known to perform very well in resource-constrained environments like on my laptop, and the AI used in this conversation was trained using a large corpus of text data that was carefully curated to ensure its accuracy and relevance.

As for alternatives considered, there are several other LLM frameworks available in the market, including GPT-3, OpenAI's GPT-2, and XLM-R, which are known to perform well in different use cases. However, RAG is a popular choice among researchers and developers due to its simplicity, performance, and versatility."

8,4,What are the ways of grouping UI elements together?,"UI elements can be grouped together using the following methods:
- Create an array of UI elements.
- Create a dictionary of UI elements.
- Embed a dynamic number of UI elements in another output.
- Create a hstack (or vstack) of UI elements with on_change handlers.
- Create a table column of buttons with on_change handlers
- Create a form with multiple UI elements.","
There are several ways to group UI elements together in MariMo:

1. Using the mo.ui.array function: This is a higher-order function that allows you to create a new UI element out of a list of UI elements. You can pass a list of UI elements as an argument and it will create a new UI element with those elements. For example, let's say you have a list of sliders like this:

```python
sliders = [mo.ui.slider(1, 10) for I in range(5)]
```

You can then use the `mo.ui.array` function to create a new UI element out of that list:

```python
grouped_sliders = mo.ui.array(sliders)
```

This will create a new UI element with 5 sliders, each wrapped in a separate slider.

2. Using the `mo.ui.grid` function: This is another higher-order function that allows you to group UI elements together horizontally or vertically. You can pass a list of UI elements as an argument and it will create a new UI element with those elements. For example, let's say you have a list of buttons like this:

```python
buttons = [mo.ui.button(""Button 1"") for I in range(5)]
```

You can then use the `mo.ui.grid` function to create a new UI element out of that list:

```python
grouped_buttons = mo.ui.grid(buttons)
```

This will create a new UI element with 5 buttons, each wrapped in a separate button.

3. Using the `mo.ui.container` function: This is another higher-order function that allows you to group UI elements together vertically. You can pass a list of UI elements as an argument and it will create a new UI element with those elements. For example, let's say you have a list of text fields like this:

```python
text_fields = [mo.ui.text_field(""Text Field 1"") for I in range(5)]
```

You can then use the `mo.ui.container` function to create a new UI element out of that list:

```python
grouped_text_fields = mo.ui.container(text_fields)
```

This will create a new UI element with 5 text fields, each wrapped in a separate text field.

These are just a few examples of how you can group UI elements together using the `mo.ui` library. The `mo.ui.array`, `mo.ui.grid`, and `mo.ui.container` functions all provide similar functionality, but with different arguments and return values."
9,4,What are the parameters for the mo.ui.text function?,The parameters for mo.ui.text are label and placeholder. These are both optional.,"
The `mo.ui.text` function in the `mo` library takes a placeholder string as its argument, which is used to display text in the UI. Here are the parameters for this function:

- `placeholder`: The placeholder string that will be displayed when the user enters text into the form. This parameter defaults to an empty string (`''`).
- `size`: The size of the input field (in characters). This parameter is optional and defaults to 30.
- `max_length`: The maximum length of the input field (in characters). This parameter is optional and defaults to None, which means that the input field can be as long as needed.
- `min_length`: The minimum length of the input field (in characters). This parameter is optional and defaults to 0, which means that the input field cannot be shorter than the specified value.
- `value`: The initial value of the input field. This parameter is optional and defaults to None.
- `onchange`: A callback function that will be called when the user changes the input field. This parameter is optional and defaults to None.

You can use these parameters to customize the appearance and behavior of your form's text input field. For example, you could set a placeholder string, specify a maximum length, or disable the input field for certain types of inputs (e.g., numbers only)."
10,5,What are the given examples of common challenges?,"The given examples of common challenges are: ""you create a comprehensive analysis but nobody is acting on it""; ""you ran an experiment but nobody is using the results""; ""you built a predictive model, but the team you built it for is not using it""; and ""you created a dashboard but nobody is looking at it"".","
Here are some examples of common chaullenges:

1. The project is not aligned with the company's goals or values.
2. The project team is not skilled enough to deliver the expected results.
3. The project scope has changed since the initial planning, and the new requirements require additional resources or changes in approach.
4. The project timeline is too short, and the project team is unable to complete it within the given time frame.
5. The project budget is insufficient, and the project team is unable to deliver the expected results within the allocated budget.
6. The project is not being executed in a timely manner, which is causing delays or missed deadlines.
7. The project is not meeting the desired outcomes, and the project team is unable to identify the root cause of the issue.
8. The project is not being managed effectively, leading to delays, missed milestones, or a lack of progress.

10. The project team is not working collaboratively and effectively, leading to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delays."
11,5,What are the four steps to become more impact-focused?,"The four steps to become more impact-focused are: ""Step 1: Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly"", ""Step 2: Ensure your work solves a real business problem"", ""Step 3: Ensure there is buy-in for your work"", and ""Step 4: Focus your time on the highest-impact thing"".","
Sure, here are the four steps to become more impact-focus:

1. Understand what impact looks like for your role and measure your success accordingly.
2. Stop thinking about productivity metrics like ""I launched 5 experiments"" or ""I built this model."" Hold yourself accountable to driving impact.
3. Focus your time on the highest-impact thing. No matter what role you're in, you're likely juggling multiple priorities. To maximize your impact, you need to ensure you spend the majority of your time on the most important thing.
4. Common challenges and how to address them:
a) Focusing on one project at a time can help you avoid burnout and stay focused on your goals.
b) Setting clear goals and milestones can help you measure progress and stay accountable.
c) Taking breaks and recharging can help you stay energized and productive.
d) Prioritizing tasks based on their impact can help you make the most of your time and focus on what's most important."
12,6,What are the risk classifications for AI?,"The risk classifications are: ""minimal risk"", ""high-risk"", ""unacceptable risk"", and ""specific transparency risk""","
The risk classification for AI systems is based on the intended purpose of the system, in line with the existing EU product safety legislation. The Commission proposes a risk‚Äìbased approach, with four levels of risk for AI systems:

25,12,What things will cause a compilation error in Gleam?,"In Gleam, let and = can be used for pattern matching, but you‚Äôll get compile errors if there‚Äôs a type mismatch. Functions can optionally have their argument and return types annotated in Gleam. These type annotations will always be checked by the compiler and throw a compilation error if not valid.

The following code will also throw a compilation error:
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch","
In GlleaM, there are several things that can cause a compilation error:

1. Incorrect type annotations: If the type annotation for a variable or function is incorrect, it will not be checked by the compiler and will result in a compilation error. For example, if you try to assign an integer value to a string variable, the compiler will complain that the type of the variable does not match the type of the assigned value.

2. Unsupported types: GlleaM supports only certain types for variables and functions. If you try to use a type that is not supported by GlleaM, it will result in a compilation error. For example, if you try to assign an integer value to a string variable, the compiler will complain that the type of the assigned value does not match the type of the variable.

3. Incorrect function signatures: If the function signature is incorrect, it will not be checked by the compiler and will result in a compilation error. For example, if you try to call a function with an incorrect number of arguments or return type, the compiler will complain that the function signature does not match the actual function definition.

4. Incorrect variable names: If the variable name is not unique within the scope of the program, it can cause a compilation error. For example, if you try to assign two different variables with the same name, the compiler will complain that there is already an existing variable with the same name.

5. Unsupported features: GlleaM supports some features that are not supported by other programming languages. If you try to use a feature that is not supported by GlleaM, it will result in a compilation error. For example, if you try to use a built-in function that is not supported by GlleaM, the compiler will complain that the function does not exist or has an incorrect signature."
26,13,Where is broadcasting used?,"Broadcasting is used to do the < comparision between the column vector [0, 1, 2, 3] and the row vector [0, 1, 2, 3], which is one of the steps to make a causal language modelling mask. Broadcasting is also used to add pos_emb and tok_emb elementwise to get the new representations of the tokens with positional information.","
Broadcasting is a technique used in machine learning to distribute data across multiple machines or devices. It allows for the efficient and parallel processing of large datasets, which can be challenging to process on a single machine. In the context of machine learning, broadcasting is commonly used when training a neural network model on a distributed dataset.

In the context of deep learning, broadcasting is often used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. CNNs are designed to work with large datasets and can be computationally expensive to train on a single machine. By distributing the training data across multiple machines or devices, broadcasting allows for faster and more efficient training of the model.

In addition to image classification tasks, broadcasting is also used in other deep learning applications such as natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition. In these cases, broadcasting can be used to distribute the training data across multiple machines or devices, allowing for parallel processing of the data."

She also remembered that she had almost killed her brother, Perry, seven hundred and thirty days ago in a car accident, when she actually did kill her brother in that accident.","
In the conversation between Jackie and Perry, Jackie remembers differently to what she saw. She doesn't remember seeing her father drinking or being drunk, but instead, she remembers hearing her daad encouraging her to have one more drink before they had their special time together. This difference in memory makes it difficult for Jackie to reconcile the truth with the lies that her mother and daad told her about her father's behavior."
29,14,What references to alcohol are there,"The narrator, Jackie, had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days. Seven hundred and thirty days ago, Jackie and Perry had gotten into a car accident that almost killed the two because Jackie had been driving after drinking Bacardi Limon.

Jackie saw a translucent memmory of her dad sitting motionless at a table with an empty glass of Apple-Schnapple and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Jackie also remembered he father giving her beer as a child and her mother ignoring this.

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.

Finally, at the end of the story, Jackie licked the cracks on her lips as her eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on her tongue. She felt herself drift, which she thought a good thing, because she needed the rest.","
There are several references to alcohol in the conversation between the user and the AI. Here are some examples:

- ""Do you remember that first drink Daad ever gave you?"" - This is a reference to the fact that Perry has been drinking heavily since his sobriety began, which could be interpreted as an indication of his addiction to alcohol.
- ""You‚Äôre remembering the truth about mom and daad"" - This phrase could be interpreted as Perry trying to remind himself or others of a past event that he has been struggling with, such as the memory of a traumatic experience.
- ""How did you‚Ä¶"" - This is a question that Perry asks the user, indicating that he is asking her about something related to his addiction."

38,19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text‚Äôs suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","
The recommended way to index text for question-answering is sentence-level indexing. Sentence-level indexing involves breaking down the text into individual sentences and then indexing each sentence separately. This approach ensures that each sentence has a unique identifier, which can be used to retrieve specific sentences or fragments of text. Here are some steps to follow when implementing sentence-level indexing for question-answering:

1. Tokenize the text: Use a tokenizer to split the text into individual words and phrases.

2. Index each sentence separately: For each sentence, use a separate index to store its unique identifier (i.e., its token).

3. Create a query model: Use a query model to combine the tokens of multiple sentences to produce a single query. This can be done using a combination of Boolean operators and wildcards.

4. Index the query: Store the query in an index, along with any other relevant information such as the document or question.

5. Query the index: Use the query model to retrieve specific sentences or fragments of text based on the user's query.

6. Re-index the results: After retrieving the desired sentences or fragments, re-index them in the same way they were originally stored. This ensures that the index remains accurate and up-to-date.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your text is indexed accurately for use in question-answering systems."
39,19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries.","
The BM25 algorithm is a popular retrieval method that has been widely used in search engines and information retrieval systems. Here are some of its advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:
1. High efficiency: The BM25 algorithm is efficient, which means it can quickly retrieve relevant documents based on the query terms.
2. Robustness: The BM25 algorithm is robust to changes in the query terms, making it suitable for use with dynamic search engines.
3. Flexibility: The BM25 algorithm allows for customization of the relevance score by adjusting the weights of different query terms.
4. Scalability: The BM25 algorithm can handle large datasets and is scalable to large search engines.

Disadvantages:
1. Limited flexibility: The BM25 algorithm does not allow for customization of the relevance score beyond the default values, which may limit its applicability in some cases.
2. Dependence on pre-trained models: The BM25 algorithm relies on pre-trained language models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) or RoBERTa, which can be expensive to train and may not be available for all use cases.
3. Limited applicability: While the BM25 algorithm is widely used in search engines, it may not be as effective for other applications like natural language processing or machine learning.
4. Complexity: The BM25 algorithm requires a lot of computational resources and can be computationally expensive to optimize.

Overall, while the BM25 algorithm has several advantages, it also has some limitations that should be considered when using it in search engines or other applications."
